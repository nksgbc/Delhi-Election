We've undertaken a comprehensive data analysis project focusing on Indian parliamentary elections in Delhi across multiple years. 
Starting with data acquisition from Wikipedia using web scraping techniques, we collected information on election results,
voter turnout, elected members, and winning parties for the years 1999, 2004, 2009, 2014, and 2019. 
Leveraging Python libraries like BeautifulSoup and pandas, we extracted, cleaned, and structured the data into usable formats.

Further, we utilized SQL databases to store and manage the collected data efficiently. 
With SQL queries, we created tables, inserted data, and performed various data manipulation tasks to organize and prepare the dataset for analysis. 
Exploratory data analysis (EDA) techniques were employed to uncover trends, patterns, and insights in voter behavior, 
party performance, and electoral outcomes across different constituencies and election years.

Some observations based on the three general elections: 

1. Delhi generally tends to vote the party that will come in power. 
2. In the three general elections, the party gave full majority(all the 7 seats) to the winning party.
3. 2014 was the most closely fought election among the three, as the vote margin was the least. The point to be noted is this was the year of change of government.
4. Chandni Chwok and New Delhi are the most closely fought constituency. Winning vote margin has increased significantly in all the other 5 seats.
5. 2014 was also the year of highest voter turnout among all the three.
6. Conclusion: Although the data is limited, during the year of change of government the elections are most closely fought and the voter turnout is highest.
   Voters come out ot vote when they feel that their votes can make a difference.
