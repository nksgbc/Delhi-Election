We've undertaken a comprehensive data analysis project focusing on Indian parliamentary elections in Delhi across multiple years. 
Starting with data acquisition from Wikipedia using web scraping techniques, we collected information on election results,
voter turnout, elected members, and winning parties for the years 2009, 2014, and 2019. 
Leveraging Python libraries like BeautifulSoup and pandas, we extracted, cleaned, and structured the data into usable formats.

Further, we utilized SQL databases to store and manage the collected data efficiently. 
With SQL queries, we created tables, inserted data, and performed various data manipulation tasks to organize and prepare the dataset for analysis. 
Exploratory data analysis (EDA) techniques were employed to uncover trends, patterns, and insights in voter behavior, 
party performance, and electoral outcomes across different constituencies and election years.
